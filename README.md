# justfriends

A web application using Java and JavaScript allowing users to meet new friends based on criteria provided.

MySQL used to store user data and jdbc to query. RiveScript used to create simple chatbot.

Test accounts made via [python scrape](https://github.com/marthaczerwik/jsfrScrape). Additional root users for testing: username: root /pw:1234, username: root2/pw:4321

Interface updates accordingly if session is created upon login.
